      <p> Hi! I'm Adam and thanks for checking out my profile page! I'm interested in learning several things throughout
        the internship. First I'd like to learn how to build scalable applications and understand the considerations and
        thought process needed in making it reliable and secure. Second, I'd like to learn the methodology taken by the
        engineering team when developing new features on existing products as well as when building an entirely new
        product. Learning how an end product/feature goal is broken down into actionable steps within the framework of
        what the product manager is aiming for would be incredibly insightful. Lastly, I'd like to learn how the
        engineering team looks at finding areas of product improvements and how they determine the priority of such
        tasks while balancing other critical projects. </p>
      <p> I wanted to become a software engineer after I started learning Javascript and began building small
        applications. I realized it's a great mix of both creativity and logical thinking, where you can test out things
        and iterate quickly, get feedback, and continuously improve without having to wait very long. I see it much like
        being a real estate developer, except that the iteration and feedback loop is much faster. I grew up playing
        games such as Sim City and Roller Coaster Tycoon, and found that building process to be immensely enjoyable and
        interesting. And with software engineering it's an incredible opportunity to actually make things that
        potentially could impact millions of people and businesses in a positive way. </p>
      <p> I'd love to work within full stack or front end, where I can make software that will better help connect both
        the online and offline worlds. I'd like to help work on improving existing products and finding out what are the
        main pressure points currently and how we can make updates that will help improve the service. Additionally, it
        would be great to help with the development process of scaling existing products effectively.</p>
      <p> Thanks again for your consideration! If you're interested in learning more about my background as well
        projects, please click on my name on the left. Thanks!</p>
